- `uv run pytest -q` — 100 passed
- Mock `list_markets` / books; pytest stays offline
- `paper_run.py` source never contains `AsyncSecureClient`
- Unreachable public API raises `PublicApiError` (no fake gaps)
- Universe filter: binary, accepting, no delay, no neg-risk, no 5/15-minute crypto windows
- `report_paper.py` prints gaps, intents, maker/taker EV, reject reasons
- README documents a 1-hour paper run
- `ALLOW_LIVE` was not created. Live trading is not enabled. No secrets committed.
- Remaining: Task 12 stays dark.

Paper dashboard (not Task 12): read-only local UI to watch paper runner logs.

- `scripts/paper_ui.py` — stdlib `http.server`, bind `127.0.0.1:8765`
- Counts from `stats.json` (written by the paper runner) or JSONL
- Reject-reason breakdown, recent gaps/intents, halt from `HALT` / `state.sqlite` (read-only)
- Auto-refresh every 2s
- Offline fixture tests under `tests/fixtures/paper_ui/`
- `uv run pytest -q` — 110 passed
- `ALLOW_LIVE` was not created. Live trading is not enabled. No secrets committed.

Paper $500 bankroll + local Start/Stop / watch-rotate slider: see `docs/plans/cursor-paper-bankroll-pnl.md`. Not real money.
