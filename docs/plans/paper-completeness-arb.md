# Plan (paper-only)

Not financial advice. No guaranteed PnL. Do not enable live trading. Do not create `ALLOW_LIVE`.

## Task 1 — Scaffold — done

Repo layout, MIT license, paper-default `Settings`, Decimal money helpers, dual live gate. Cursor: OK `15db598`.

## Task 2 — Fees (pure function) — done

Protocol taker fee `C * feeRate * p * (1-p)`. Makers pay 0. Never include maker rebates in EV. Cursor: OK `0c890a1`.

## Task 3 — Book store + ask walk — done

Reconstruct YES/NO books from snapshots + `price_change` deltas. Walk ask depth (VWAP); do not size by mid or top-of-book only. Cursor: OK `2eaac20`.

## Task 4 — Hunter — done

Emit `GapFound` only for depth-sized ask gaps (`yes_vwap + no_vwap <= 1 - min_edge` and fillable >= min_size). Uses asks, never mids. Cursor: OK `b57f722`.

## Task 5 — Risk agent — done

Refuse halted, non-binary, delayed, neg-risk, stale, too-good, over-pair, daily-loss, uncompletable, and over-notional gaps. May clip size to `max_notional_per_trade` and re-walk both sides. Cursor: OK `c3fc647`.

## Task 6 — Fee agent — done

Prefer `maker_gtc` when maker EV > 0. Allow `taker_fak` only if taker EV > 0 after protocol fees + `0.005`/share buffer. Rebates never in EV. Cursor: OK `d2d2acc`.

## Task 7 — Paper executor + bus wiring — done

In-process bus. `run_pipeline` (hunt → risk → intent). `PaperBroker` writes JSONL under gitignored `data/`. `LiveBroker` raises unless `live_allowed()`. Cursor: OK `0f46af0`.

## Task 8 — Merge + naked-leg hedge (simulated) — done

Paper merge returns `min(yes, no)` with no network. After timeout, sell leftover naked size FAK (`incident=True`). Live merge raises (Task 12). Cursor: OK `13c0fa0`.

## Task 9 — Kill switch, state dump, preflight — done

Crash-safe sqlite state (path injectable, default `data/state.sqlite`). Paper preflight skips secrets. Live preflight would check geoblock (injected fetcher), keys, `ALLOW_LIVE` date, and caps — default tests stay offline. Kill switch trips on daily loss, `HALT` file, stale WS, or ≥3 hedge incidents / hour. After halt: refuse new intents; do not auto-resume. Paper only sets `halted=True` (live `cancel_all` is Task 12). Cursor: OK `b67c958`.

## Task 10 — Recorder + backtest + adversary — done

Replay recorded asks+bids+depth (never last-trade or mid). Model one-leg FAK miss (`p_miss` default 0.3) and independent maker rest fills. Subtract protocol taker fees; charge hedge slippage on naked legs. Report trades, completed pairs, naked incidents, net PnL, capital turns. Adversary detectors catch mid-fill and lookahead lies. Cursor: OK `6d51143`.

## Task 11 — Paper runner (networked, no orders) — done

`scripts/paper_run.py` lists open markets via `AsyncPublicClient.list_markets(closed=False)`, filters the v1 universe, subscribes (or polls) YES/NO books, and runs hunt → risk → fee → paper executor. Writes `data/paper/gaps.jsonl` and `data/paper/intents.jsonl`. Never constructs a secure trading client. Unreachable API fails clearly and does not fake gaps. `scripts/report_paper.py` prints gaps, intents, estimated maker/taker EV, and reject reasons.

Tests: `uv run pytest -q`.

## Paper dashboard (not Task 12) — done

Read-only local UI (`scripts/paper_ui.py`, stdlib `http.server`) watches gitignored paper JSONL + optional `stats.json` / sqlite under `--data-dir` (default `data/paper`). Banner is paper-only. Binds `127.0.0.1:8765`. Missing logs show zeros. Paper $500 bankroll, realized PnL, Start/Stop, watch-rotate slider. Never places live orders. Not Task 12.

## Remaining

12. Live path (build dark, do not run) — not now
